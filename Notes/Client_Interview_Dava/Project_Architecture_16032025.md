1. Q. **Project: TruBuy - Device Buyback & Reverse Logistics Solution**  
### **1. Project Overview**  
TruBuy is a software solution in the **reverse logistics chain**, primarily dealing with second-hand and used electronic devices. 
The entire Reverse logistics solution bird-eye view like:  
    1. **Device Buyback** â€“ Customers return their devices, and the system evaluates their worth.  
    2. **Warehouse Processing** â€“ Devices are graded, erased, tested, and repackaged.  
    3. **Auction & Disposition** â€“ Refurbished devices are auctioned, while failed devices are scrapped.  

#### **System Architecture**  
- **Frontend:** PHP (Laravel)  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Mulesoft  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Cloud Services:** AWS S3 for storing images, certificates, and versioned pricing sheets  
- **Third-Party Integrations:**  
  - **PrologMobile API** â€“ Fetches IMEI-based device details for authenticity verification  
  - **JSCH Library (SFTP)** â€“ Transfers transaction data to external services  
   
##### **1. Device Buyback Process**  
1. A customer returns a used device (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro Max, 256GB, Black).  
2. The device is connected to the storeâ€™s system, which fetches IMEI, make, model, and color.  
3. The system triggers a **transaction initiation API**.  
4. **Transaction Module (Backend API - Spring Boot):**  
   - **HTTP Methods:** `POST`, `PUT`, `GET`  
   - **Transaction ID Generation:** Combines store ID, station ID, and timestamp.  
   - **Profile Master Table:** Determines SKU based on `deviceType | make | model | memory | color`.  
   - **Transaction Master Table:**  
     - Stores details like `skuId | deviceType | grade | cash_price | credit_price | final_price | offer_state`.  
   - **Pricing Master Table:** Determines price based on SKU and grade.  
5. The customer is offered a price based on device grading. Options:  
   - Accept: Completes the transaction, marking it as **Success**.  
   - Decline: Cancels the transaction.  
   - Failure: Occurs due to evaluation issues.  

##### **2. Store Management & Data Analytics**  
- Migrated store data from Excel sheets to the database for forecasting and analytics.  
- Normalized data and integrated it with the system.  
- Developed utilities for **SFTP transfer of transaction data** to other services (e.g., Midas product for device processing before auctioning).  

##### **3. AWS S3 Integration**  
- Stored images of different device types dynamically.  
- Maintained version-wise certificates and pricing sheets for tracking offer price changes.  

##### **4. Auction & Disposition**
