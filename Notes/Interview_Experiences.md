### Prepare
- Elevators Pitch
- Java : 
    OOP 
     - Encapsulation - hides internal state -> access modifiers ,method getter setters
     - Abstraction -  hides the complex implementation details and exposes only the essential features -> interfaces and abstract classes
     - Inheritance - interfaces, composition
     - Polymorphism - compile time and runtime polymorphism
-  Exception Handling
-  Collections 
-  Multithreading
